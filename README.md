1) Save the data (using arrays and objects)
2) Generate the HTML (using .map() and key prop)
3) Make it interactive, using onClick and onChange
4) State = data that changes over time, and is connected to the HTML
5) Updater function = update the state and update the HTML
6) Array Destructuring
7) Lifting the State Up = share state between components.
8) 'className' attribute in react is converted to class attribute in html because class is a reserved keyword
